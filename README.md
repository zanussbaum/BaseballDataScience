# BaseballRegression

This a personal repository that will serve as a starting point for my exploration into Machine Learning.

Currently, each model will be stored in a folder for readability.

hit_prediction uses a RandomForestClassifier to classify whether a batted ball was a hit or not, using Statcast metrics as features. 

base_out uses a neural net to predict (with 98% accuracy!) how many runs scored in an inning based on the events of that inning.
